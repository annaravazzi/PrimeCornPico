# PrimeCorn Raspberry Pi Pico code

This is the microcontroller code for the *PrimeCorn* project. Check the [app](https://github.com/GustavoAdamee/BikeBrainApp) and the [RaspberryPi](https://github.com/GustavoAdamee/seed-classify) code for more.

## About the project

*PrimeCorn* is a project that aims to create a machine that mechanically separates regular corn seeds from irregular ones, a prototype that would help small-scale farmers with selecting appropriate seeds for planting.

This project was developed for the Integration Workshop 3 course, Computer Engineering â€” UTFPR.
